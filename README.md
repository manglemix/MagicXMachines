# Magic / Machines

This is a fictional story that I write in my free time. It is completely free and written in pure HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages.

The intended way to read it is from [GitHub Pages](https://manglemix.github.io/MagicXMachines/). The source code is public, but there may be spoilers
in the form of comments, or simply content that I am unsure about keeping. The whole story is in a state of flux, and changes may still be made to earlier
chapters. You can refer to the commit history to see if changes did occur, but I am not following a proper commit format.

## AI Disclosure

Generative AI (Claude, Gemini) is only used for the following purposes:

1. Preliminary Research - Finding starting points for researching some topic, such as "What are the main causes of failure in electric motors?"
2. Grammar Checking - They can catch some very nuanced grammatical errors, but of course they do not replace qualified human proofreaders.
3. Repetitive word/phrase usage - Also good at catching times where I overuse words. However, I still decide what words to replace them with.
4. Writing HTML - I used Claude to write a template for the HTML and to disable all default CSS. It's just faster than trying to remember what a basic HTML page is supposed to look like.

Most notably, I do not use AI to write any portion of the story, nor do I ask for any ideas. This book is purely my creation.

## Errors

This repo represents a *working* copy of the story, and each chapter may either be incomplete, awaiting proofreading, or some other state. As such, there may be issues such as grammar and typos. If you spot a problem, I would appreciate if you raised an issue or even made a fork with the fixes. However, I completely understand if you don't want to. After all, I do **not** intend to offload work to my readers.

## Inspirations

1. Infinity Blade - I love the mixture of medieval, fantasy, and sci-fi, and it is easily the biggest influence. I have played all 3 games and I miss them every year they are not of the App Store, especially since I didn't finish the second game!
2. Demon Slayer Anime - Being a big fan of the anime, I felt some issues with the writing and felt I could write a better power hierarchy, but I really enjoy the way they show the growth of Tanjiro and his strength relative to others.
3. LOTR Movies - I am not a big fan of LOTR, but I did grow up watching the movies, including the Hobbit. Their style of worldbuilding in the movies is what I try to emulate, but I understand some people had issues with it.
4. Cyberpunk 2077 Anime - Also a big fan of this anime. However, I did not take many themes from it as it was too dark. Mainly it was some of the technology I took.
5. SCP - Loved playing the OG game, but I only took inspiration from the cognito hazard style SCPs.
6. GhostRunner I & II - Hadn't really heard of the game before it was free on Epic Games, but I like the Hong Kong style architecture of the levels, but there is not much else I took from it.
