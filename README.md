# Magic / Machines

This is a fictional story that I write in my free time. It is completely free and written in pure HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages.

The intended way to read it is from [GitHub Pages](https://manglemix.github.io/MagicXMachines/). The source code is public, but there may be spoilers
in the form of comments, or simply content that I am unsure about keeping. The whole story is in a state of flux, and changes may still be made to earlier
chapters. You can refer to the commit history to see if changes did occur, but I am not following a proper commit format.
