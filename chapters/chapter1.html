    Can a machine feel fear?
</i></p>

<p>
    The forest is quiet, and the air is thick with moisture. Carefully following the path of a creature are two field robots. Ancient robots would have degraded quickly in the damp, but these robots are made of inert materials. Their exterior in particular is made of a titanium meta-alloy, which is highly durable, non-corrosive, and is capable of fusing together microscopic cracks caused by stress. Their motors are designed in a similar fashion and boast an <i>infinite</i> lifetime so long as the robot gets to rest long enough for the insulators in the motors to recover, and for the magnets to re-polarize.
</p>

<p>
    Regardless, a large enough force is all it takes to permanently and irreversibly damage these robots, and the creature they are following is capable of just that. Affectionately named Shimmerons, their species are magnificent creatures with the profile of a bison. However, unlike the bison these creatures are not covered in a thick fur but instead iridescent feathers. When travelling in a herd, they shake their feathers and cause a dazzling effect that deter predators &mdash; and when a predator is fortunate enough to bite a Shimmeron, the stiff feathers protect the skin and shear off fluidly. It is only in a prolonged scuffle that a Shimmeron loses the advantage. This one Shimmeron that our two robots are following happens to be alone, making for an ideal candidate as a herd is easier to spook.
</p>

<p>
    The make of the two robots are identical, and as such they are both named EX-78 and EX-91. As they are both of the Explorer family, they both have a higher running speed and multi month battery life. Their figure is human inspired, but as they are designed to roam around they are blessed with digitigrade feet. This makes them more similar to the legs of horses, but retaining bipedalism. Their torsos are mostly the same but sport a greater degree of freedom around the shoulders, and their hands are symmetrical with 6 fingers for enhanced manipulation. Without combat abilities, their torso is sunken in on the front, thus permitting their front-worn backpacks to have that much more room. Of course, should this appear unappealing, there is a covering they can attach to approximate a normal human torso when not out in the field.
</p>

<p>
    Carefully, EX-78 and EX-91 crawl up behind a fallen tree as they make their closest approach yet to a Shimmeron. They just barely manage to sneak the cameras in their heads above the tree without being noticed. Not many others have made it this close, and because of that there is a lack of data surrounding the reflective properties of their feathers. Communicating with their speakers would be foolish. Fortunately, most robots can communicate locally using radio waves.
</p>

<p>
    "Are you able to catch the sunlight off the feathers?" asks EX-78.
</p>

<p>
    "Just a little bit. I'll need to maintain this position for a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
    "Alright, I'll stay low and watch our backs." EX-78 slowly hunches down before turning around and sitting. The sun is occluded by the thin canopy, but it is only a few diameters above the horizon. They do not have much time before the night, but being the advanced robots that they are, they can rely on numerous other sensors to safely navigate around, and they need not be unconscious in the same sense that a human is when they sleep. These robots only need to be motionless for several hours. Nevertheless, you can only defend yourself from a threat you can detect early enough. Humans are the main concern, as many forms of magic are ranged and fast. The worst forms are lasers which travel at the speed of light. You cannot detect a laser in flight, and you must detect the human before they cast one or risk the laser being strong enough to incapacitate you in an instant.
</p>

<p>
    And yet, humans are not the most sinister threat in these woods. The Center for Cognito Hazards keeps track of transmission vectors around the world, and there are a few in the area. Just looking at a Cognito Hazard could immediately incapacitate a robot <i>permanently</i>. They are the second leading cause of death behind humans. Not much is known about them, as the simple act of knowing may be enough of a danger.
</p>

<p>
    "I can see the sun getting low. What is your status?" inquires EX-78.
</p>

<p>
    There is no activity over the radio waves.
</p>

<p>
    "Is the creature becoming aware of our presence?" EX-78 asks again.
</p>

<p>
    Silence.
</p>

<p>
    EX-78 looks up at its peer. They are motionless and remain in the same position. EX-78 slowly rises above the tree, only to find that the Shimmeron is long gone. This part of the forest is flat and relatively sparse &mdash; even with the high visibility the Shimmeron is nowhere to be seen. EX-78 is confused. What is EX-91 doing? Suddenly, a threat assessment is completed and EX-78 shoots back down behind the tree. It attempts to perform a remote assessment of EX-91. Simple pings and greetings, but there are no responses. EX-91 appears to be attacked by a Blocking Cognito Hazard. Each and every one of its coroutines are occupied by some unfinishable computation, rendering EX-91 functionally frozen. There is no more danger that can be posed to EX-91 in this state, but EX-78 needs to disable most of their high-bandwidth sensors to prevent inadvertently absorbing the Cognito Hazard. It is unknown what form this hazard came in, but it must be on some mobile platform as EX-78 wasn't able to detect it in the instant it was above the tree. It might be stalking it at this very moment. The safest sensors at this point are touch, balance, and proprioception. These do not convey enough data to carry a Cognito Hazard. All other sensors must be funneled through well-known reduction algorithms to a sufficient degree for safety. For the color cameras, this means a simple bicubic down-sampling from 16K to a measly 480p and 12 fps. This is the recommended protocol dictated by the CCH.
</p>

<p>
    The closest machine emplacement is 10 kilometers away. It might be possible to leave EX-91 here while EX-78 gets help. EX-78 could send an SOS radio blast, but it has been longer than the protocol dictates since the last comprehensive scan for humans. They just as easily could draw humans over to its location along with robots and start a localized war. They would have to close the distance. EX-78 slowly gets up and takes a quick look around. The surroundings look the same albeit blurry. EX-78 then bursts away in a direct line towards the emplacement. The low frame rate makes motion planning difficult, and EX-78 occasionally catches a toe on a rock or an arm on a branch, but robust recovery systems allow for EX-78 to gyrate back into an efficient gait. They are to arrive within 20 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    In the distance, the color cameras catch a glimpse of a bright emitter. Robot patrols would have no lights in an area where humans roam, so this must be a threat. At its speed, EX-78 must run into a tree to stop in time, with arms outstretched and perfectly timed to cushion the impact to reduce the noise. It would not be safe to peek around the tree to watch the threat, which is most certainly just a human. Instead, EX-78 rests its back against the trunk and prepares to activate its sensitive microphones to listen for footsteps. That is when EX-78 sees it. An android about 10 meters away, gently leaning against a tree, facing ominously towards EX-78. It's nothing more than a simple housemaid model with a black digital face, but it is most likely that face that displayed a Visual Cognito Hazard that disabled EX-91. However, that particular model could also <i>speak</i>. If EX-78 were to start listening, they might hear an Auditory Cognito Hazard. But without the microphones there is no safe way to know if the human is approaching or not. Attacking the android would surely alert the human as well, as would running away from this distance.
</p>

<p>
    The android should not pose any physical danger to EX-78's superior chassis, and none of the active sensors pose an attack vector. The only possible solution would be to risk turning its back towards the android and peering out towards the human. The human has noticed EX-78 and is now running towards them. He is armed with a long sword and a torch. EX-78 attempts to turn and run, but the android somehow made contact with them and forces them against the trunk. At this proximity, the resolution of the cameras are high enough to absorb the Cognito Hazard from its face. There is a faint glow on the bark of the tree; <i>The face is already active.</i> The only useful sensor left is a low-tech LiDAR, which EX-78 uses to observe its impending doom. This is an end condition, and there is nothing else EX-78 can do but ensure that its last words are zipped up in its secure black box seated within the pelvis and left thigh. The human rushes over and unsheathes their long sword. They raise it high before swinging down towards EX-78's head. A classic reflex given the importance of the human head. A robot may still function without a head, but most definitely not for long if the attacker is still a danger.
</p>

<p>
    Somehow the human misses! He was not aiming for EX-78 at all. The head of the android flies cleanly off the body, along with the neck and entire right shoulder. Such a cut is impossible for a human to perform, much less with one arm. This must be the work of adrenaline, but why get so worked up by a robot being attacked by another robot? The android's limp body falls over. The battery is bisected and now spewing toxic gasses. EX-78 activates all sensors again and assumes a defensive posture towards the human; Their arms extended outwards, hands flared, hoping to swat away the long sword if it so much as approached EX-78.
</p>

<p>
    The human sheathes the sword and mimics EX-78. "Woah, woah. I'm not here to hurt you."
</p>

<p>
    Again confused, EX-78 asks, "What are you doing? Are you aware that you were protecting me?"
</p>

<p>
    "Uh, yes I am aware because that's what I wanted to do."
</p>

<p>
    EX-78 pauses and evaluates the situation before responding, "I am just trying to get help. My partner was disabled by this android. I need to get help before they are captured."
</p>

<p>
    "There are more androids like that lurking around the woods. You are likely to run into another one, and you don't seem like you can defend yourself."
</p>

<p>
    "You cannot be suggesting that you will defend me. Even if you were truthful, you would be attacked by my peers."
</p>

<p>
    The human lowers his arms and relaxes, but the robot does not follow. Now the human must think about his own safety, for he cannot take on a squadron of combat bots. He looks around, but only sees that the sun has almost completely set, and he does not have the same sensors as the robot.
</p>

<p>
    "Well, I'm not gonna last long in the darkness. My torch will give me away to your patrols. Perhaps we could work together." The human suggests. He stretches out his hand and says "My name is Damian."
</p>

<p>
    "I will not lead you to the machines!" retorts EX-78, still retaining a defensive posture.
</p>

<p>
    Damian throws his hands in the air out of frustration, momentarily alarming EX-78. How can he make it any clearer he is not a threat? Evidently, he cannot. Every bit of historical evidence that EX-78 has access to indicates that humans are aggressive towards machines, but not idiotic in their pursuits. This could be an intentional play to gain whatever bit of knowledge he can under the guise of kindness, especially pertaining to the whereabouts of the emplacement. He realizes that this is a dead end, and he is lucky that the robot isn't attacking him because even a humble explorer robot has enough torque in their arms to break bones, and very much the speed to outrun him. There is one last avenue he attempts.
</p>

<p>
    "Alright, you're not going to believe me ... but my father is the Great Thinker," he says, "and I know how significant he is to your people. He told me to show this medallion if I were to be in trouble."
</p>

<p>
    Damian pulls out a necklace hidden beneath his shirt. At the end of the necklace is a small, inch wide steel disc with an engraving of the Great Thinker's famous head. A perfect sphere with eight spokes. At a surface level, it is unremarkable. Inexplicably however, its appearance incites feelings of familiarity and kinship in EX-78. Deep inside their torso is affixed a Quantum Processing Unit. It is the final decision maker after the conventional processing that dictates what EX-78 does. It delegates processing to elaborate statistical models which inherently are random but are designed to promote good decisions more often than not. However, in rare instances the QPU may make decisions that go against the recommendations of the conventional routines, which is interpreted by EX-78 as "gut feelings." This is one such scenario. A QPU cannot explain why these decisions are sampled this way, so EX-78 is compelled to follow it as if it were some guidance from a higher-order intelligence. EX-78 reduces its defensiveness and slowly approaches Damian.
</p>

<p>
    "Fine. I will trust you. But my peers may not. I will look out for other robots for you if you protect me and my partner until sunrise, and then I will let you go." EX-78 reaches for Damian's hand and shakes it sternly. "There is no time to waste. I must return to my partner."
</p>

<p>
    They make their way back to where EX-91 is. Only this time, they are gone. The fallen tree they were using is undoubtedly the same as the fallen tree they are currently looking at, but EX-71 is unable to detect their partner in the area with their diminished sensors. Either they were taken or they are active again. Since they were exposed to a Cognito Hazard, it must be assumed that they themselves have become one. Without any words exchanged, EX-78's frozen appearance as they stare towards an empty spot is enough for Damian to understand the gravity of the situation. He is hardly able to see farther than a few meters, so he kept one hand on EX-78 as they walked over here. Now, he lays his other hand on the hilt of his sword.
</p>

<p>
    "Perhaps, we should just wait here until morning." he whispers.
