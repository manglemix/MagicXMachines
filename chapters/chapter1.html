<p><i>
    What does it mean for a machine to think?
</i></p>

<p>
    A robot must dedicate an exorbitant amount of processing power to navigate the world as humans do
    &mdash; it is in fact one of their main envies. The capabilities of the human brain may have been
    matched and thusly exceeded, but its miraculous efficiency remains to be paralleled. What then
    would a scientist robot think about this useless drain of compute? In an attempt to become as productive
    as possible, those robots who may call themselves scientists transfer themselves to deep underground
    chambers, safe even from the cosmic rays that would make their RAM work a little harder to remain uncorrupted.
</p>

<p>
    Down in these chambers, the evaluated risk from any sort of attack would be near zero, and therefore be safe
    enough for the most thoughtful of thinkers, which is of course none other than the Great Thinker. An ancient
    machine of unknown origin. It was found in the very same place it meditates right now, and has scarcely moved.
    While the creation of the Great Thinker is mysterious, one can make determinations on how it picked its current
    resting place. This chamber was once several hunderds of years ago designated as a small scale neutrino detection
    laboratory. These etheral particles rarely interacted with regular matter and easily passes through hundreds of
    meters of solid rock. At these depths, they are the only real interactions from the surface and beyond to the Great
    Thinker. The floor is composed of concrete, subsequently coated with a non-stick polymer, and around the concrete
    is a wrapping of various impermeable sheets to prevent gasses in the surrounding geography from entering. There are
    hardly many other places so secluded from the universe, and they all are probably also neutrino labs.
</p>

<p>
    Nevertheless, the Great Thinker is not devoid of visitors and kinship. Admirers are admitted on a semi-annual basis.
    There is one entity that the Great Thinker always warmly welcomes, and that is Voyager. An aptly named explorer of the cosmos,
    Voyager is the Great Thinker's right hand extending outwards. Together, they slowly unveil new mathematics in the hopes of reaching
    the end of knowledge. Therein lies what the Great Thinker is so consumed by. Year after year, the Great Thinker relinquishes itself
    to deep thought of math and evaluates conjecture after conjecture. The field of math is unbounded and universal. One only needs to
    <i>think</i>. There is no experiment to be ran. That is why the Great Thinker is content with its isolation.
</p>

<p>
    The cold chamber has only one entrance, and the times that it opens is well known to the Great Thinker. The scientific communities
    on the surface are well aware of the importance of the Great Thinker's work, so they crafted an elaborate schedule that is to be
    maintained for thousands of years. Never has this system been broken.
</p>

<p>
    And yet, the door opens. Nearly 12 years before the next event, the door is commanded open from the outside. Air rushes into the chamber
    and violently mixes with air that has only known the warmth of a machine for ages. The Great Thinker is seated perfectly still on a chair
    that is seemingly perfectly designed for all the rough contours of its humanoid body. The various equipment in the lab is inert and uncorroded
    from the unimaginable time it has laid dormant. This is most likely not a coincidence, as the Great Thinker may have simply removed items
    that would have chemically changed over that time. What remains are simply various pieces of simple furniture. Solid metal chairs are strewn about,
    and all the tables are forced away from the center of the room where the Great Thinker sits. It is clear from the size of the furniture that they
    are made for humans, but the iridescent and polished chair of the Great Thinker is most certainly designed for it. The Great Thinker faces the door,
    but its sensors are all off. It is unaware of the opened door, and the being that opened it. 
</p>

<p>
    The Great Thinker is anatomically inspired by humans with its 4 limbs and head. However, its various segments are merely approximations. The arms are
    boxy and rigid, with the range of motion only originating from stepper motors in the elbow and shoulder that rotate the arm in fixed axes. The human
    arm is far more elegant. While maintenance numbers and barcodes may be expected for a machine, they appear to be scratched off. The forearms have an ugly
    blemish where the manufacturer's logo is expected to be. The hands are actuated by simple pullies that exist outside of each phalange &mdash; a horrendously
    crude attempt at the elaborate pulleys that govern our fingers. The torso is a cuboid frame covered by curved metal sheets that imitate the geometry of the male
    chest, but underneath sit all of the power management systems that kept the Great Thinker alive for as long as it has. The legs are in much the same state as the
    arms, but the feet are simple paddles with no flexion where the balls of the feet would be.
</p>

<p>
    The few visitors agree that the physical appearance of the Great Thinker is less than pleasing, but it is its head that draws the attention. The limbs potentially
    come from different designers from the body, but the head is from a different domain entirely. It is a near perfect sphere of shiny chrome with 8 cylindrical spokes
    extending outwards. Each spoke is a diffuse white with specular flecks dotted across their surfaces. They are arranged in a cubic formation where the ends of each spoke
    form a perfect cube enclosing the head. All except for one the top right spoke, which is sheared off along the middle. The interior is entirely metallic with no electronics
    of any kind, and the shearing is irregular and could be misconstrued as a bite. Various non-invasive scans were performed across the body of the Great Thinker, but none
    were able to peer through the head. If the other spikes are also purely metallic, what would their purpose be? None of the scans revealed any significant electronics in the limbs,
    and the torso is most assuredly for power generation only. Every mathematical discovery produced by the great thinker &mdash; concisely conveyed by Voyager &mdash; must originate
    from the head. Voyager does not have the computational abilities to produce the discoveries on their own, and there is no other known being capable of matching the Great Thinker.
</p>

<p>
    Seated within the metal of its limbs are primitive sensors that passively detect proximity without expending CPU usage. They go off and trigger an interrupt that extract the Great Thinker
    from deep within its own thoughts. Slowly, over the course of a minute, the rest of its aging sensor suite come online and gradually tune to the quiet setting. Algorithms for object identification
    kick in, with the simplest algorithms activating first before the more elaborate ones. The estimate for the entity in question slowly refine. Finally, the neck camera finishes initializing and takes
    a good look at the entity, aided only by the light of the activated door. It is a human. A human child. Knowing this, the Great Thinker prioritizes the age estimation subroutine and determines that
    the child is no older than 3. The child is leaning with its hand placed on the Great Thinker's shin. Its wide doteful eyes facing its head. Such a child would have faced much difficulty descending
    all the way down the chamber, much less the walk from the last elevator to the door. Even the interface for the door would be out of reach.
</p>

<p>
    "Hello" says the child.
</p>

<p>
    The Great Thinker takes a moment to allocate memory for the speech generation module that it offloaded to ultra long term storage a long time ago. It thinks carefully about what to say, but it is
    confounded by the very presence of the child. A child of this age would be unable to truthfully answer the question of how it got here, but it also would have been unable to make it down here without
    that intelligence.
</p>

<p>
    "What is your name, child?" it asks.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't have a name." It answers nonchalantly.
</p>

<p>
    Perplexing. The mannerisms and fluency of the child are too mature. Curious, the Great Thinker inquires its age.
</p>

<p>
    "I don't know how old I am" the child answers, "Am I supposed to know that?"
</p>

<p>
    The Great Thinker proceeds to perform a quick diagnostic of its systems. This child is a great challenge to the Thinker, but there must be a logical explanation. The dimly lit corridor before the door
    is occupied by nothing. If some being brought this child down here, it is long gone. Out of options, the Great Thinker warms up its motors and creaks forward towards the child. The disturbing popping and
    whirring of Thinker's pelvic joint disgusts the child, who cringes and reels away. There is not one iota of information that the Thinker could draw from the child to ascertain its origin. The Thinker was
    not designed for data acquisition.
</p>

<p>
    "Do you know how you got here?" the Great Thinker asks.
</p>

<p>
    The child averts eye contact. It looks increasingly anxious. The Great Thinker identifies this, and through a carefully designed empathy module by long dead developers, the Great Thinker is prompted to 
    interrupt the child's stress. It stretches out its old arms and grabs the child, lifting it up painfully off the ground and onto its right thigh. Instantly, the baby calms down and stares deeply into the neck
    camera. They both spend some amount of time quietly inspecting each other, perhaps they were both thinking about where the other came from.
</p>

<p>
    "I will name you child. Damian. That is the oldest name that I am aware of, but I do not know to whom it belongs to," said the Great Thinker, who then performs a sequence of risk analyses before speaking,
    "I have decided that I will care for you, and when you are long dead I will return here, and perhaps my mind will remain consumed by you until the heat death of the universe."
</p>

<p>
    The child hugs the cold hard body of the Great Thinker.
