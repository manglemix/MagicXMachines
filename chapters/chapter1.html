    Can a machine feel fear?
</i></p>

<p>
    "The creature has paused; We can approach it."
</p>

<p>
    The creature in question is none other than a Shimmeron. An illustrious beast, it boasts the sturdy build of a bison and is adorned with shiny iridescent feathers. The name was given to this species by humans of all things for its inclination to shake its feathers when approached by a predator. The dazzling feathers reflect the sunlight brilliantly, so the lack of such shimmer is what informed the two field robots following it that the beast is currently tame.
</p>

<p>
    The two robots, identical in make, are named EX-78 and EX-91. They are of the explorer class of robots, and their purpose is to foray into the wilderness and catalog the creatures of the New World. The structure of a Shimmeron's feathers is the interest of the current expedition, as the iconic rainbow hues of the feathers are no doubt due to thin-film interference. The question is, how does the Shimmeron consistently pull off this effect? The two robots carefully sneak up behind a fallen tree, making the closest ever approach to such creatures in the history of these expeditions. Quick to leverage the proximity, EX-91 slowly raises their head above the tree and captures high resolution data of the animal as it is eating from a berry bush. Each feather is no longer than 10 centimeters, and yet from a distance of over 5 meters EX-91's cameras are precise enough to capture sub-millimeter details. With enough time, they can refine their observations to resolve even micrometer sized structures, thus elucidating the mystery of the feathers. Being the advanced robots as they are, they need not communicate with speech. They instead opt to communicate over near-range radio.
</p>

<p>
    "Are you able to capture the feathers?" asks EX-78.
</p>

<p>
    "Yes, very much so. I will need as much time as we can afford."
</p>

<p>
    EX-78 lays out of sight &mdash; back against the tree &mdash; and looks out at the surroundings. They pursued the Shimmeron into a boreal forest, but it took them many hours of sunlight to get to this point. The sun is barely visible through the sparse canopy, but it is obvious they do not have much time before the sunset. EX-78 compiles his estimate of time remaining before there is too little sunlight to make meaningful observations and beams it to his partner. The Shimmeron was peaceful, and all they had to do now was collect their data and return back to the forward base. It has been a long excursion for these two, but this is nothing compared to what they are designed for. They excel against other classes of robots at movement efficiency and speed. If the world was a walkable sphere, they could circumnavigate the equator in one charge. The key is their digitigrade feet which likens them to bipedal horses. As a result, they can sprint in excess of 90 kilometers per hour continuously without producing much heat. As EX-78 tucks themselves into a stable seating position, their joints make no sound. Sound is wasted energy and wear; Their designers laboriously refined the electric motor that they're blessed with, and when combined with ample rest they are capable of having an infinite lifetime.
</p>

<p>
    As the minutes pass, EX-78 studiously looks out for any signs of threats. Robots always emit a whole host of detectable emissions. Near-range radio may not be parsable from a distance, but its presence is otherwise noted. Even their miraculous motors produce high frequency squeaks under some strains. Indeed, it is not robots that EX-78 is afraid of &mdash; Humans are harder to spot, and arguably a larger threat. Humanity and Machine have been at war for many many years, and when the humans were cornered into extinction they cultivated their last stand from deep within their souls. They found their salvation in magic. Ever since then, they've mastered it into dangerous sorcery that keeps them farther from annihilation than they have ever been. Being the clever creatures that they are, humans knew they could never beat robots in speed and reflexes. As such, they've focused on ranged magic that outclasses even conventional firearms. If EX-78 is not careful, a human patrol could lob a potent corrodent and incapacitate the two of them before they could ever spot the humans' heat signatures.
</p>

<p>
    "I believe it is likely that humans may be patrolling the area. Some of the images I've taken have possible footprints. I suggest we return soon." Expecting a response over the waves, EX-78 gets nothing.
</p>

<p>
    Perhaps they are in the middle of a prolonged computation &mdash; on the verge of a breakthrough. EX-78 affords to wait another minute. Nevertheless, there is no response. The Shimmeron might be expressing a new, never before seen behavior that demands all of EX-91's attention. EX-78 slowly peeks above the tree. Their sensors were tuned for long distance scanning and intentionally filtered out any stimulus from the Shimmeron. As is now apparent, that was not necessary as the Shimmeron is seemingly long gone. The infrared heat from its footprints are barely visible, and the bush is comprehensively desecrated. And yet, EX-91 maintains their stare into nothingness. As is the protocol, EX-78 produces tens of possible theories and begins evaluating each concurrently. Billions upon billions of calculations per second, and it takes no more than half a second for a harrowing threat assessment to complete. EX-78 immediately shuts off all sensors except for touch, balance, and proprioception, and forces themselves down on the ground. This is a situation that they were trained for, but never before had EX-78 needed to actually apply that training. Given the circumstances, it is probable that EX-91 has been struck by a <i>Cognito Hazard</i>.
</p>

<p>
    The robots of the New World utilize highly advanced neural networks that are capable of ingesting large volumes of data and performing highly elaborate and non-linear computations to make intelligent decisions. These models often have billions upon trillions of components (parameters), and the full range of behaviors that these models could exhibit is unknown. Even so, their usage is prolific throughout the operating system of these robots. Their decision-making itself is self-referential; They only perform computations they understand, and they must understand a computation to perform it. This practically eliminates all classes of computer viruses as the robots can never be misled into running a malicious program. Though, this has led to a new evolution of viruses that prey on the unpredictable nature of these neural networks in unheard of situations, thus spawning the class of threats known as the Cognito Hazard. The very act of absorbing a Cognito Hazard, whatever form it may be whether its visual noise or an audible screech, leads to the target neurons being activated in precisely the wrong ways. EX-91 may have been forced into an infinite loop of computation, but EX-78 might react differently and be irreversibly damaged, or themselves become a Cognito Hazard.
</p>

<p>
    A re-prioritization of the mission objectives is in order. EX-78 brings up the latest procedures for a Cognito Hazard that they are aware of. The Center for Cognito Hazards maintains this document, and they recommend disabling high-bandwidth sensors as they are the main attack vector. It is simply not possible to convey enough data through something as simple as a gyroscope, but the highly advanced cameras they've been using to record their Shimmeron are now working against them. But a robot can't operate completely in the blind. EX-78 determines that the best course of action, given the unknown nature of the Cognito Hazard, is to run back to base at full speed, and it may be possible to do so with a diminished resolution and frame rate. There is no time to waste.
</p>

<p>
    EX-78 launches up and away from the tree and heads in a straight line towards the camp. If there are humans in the area, EX-78 will attempt to dodge their attacks with their superior speed. All that is certain is if EX-78 is frozen by that Cognito Hazard, they are as good as dead anyway; All that speed amounting to nothing. The obstacle detection system is having a hard time managing with the available sensors. It is only inevitable that EX-78's foot snags on a root, sending them tumbling forward several meters. No matter, they get up again and sprint forth with no loss in cadence. Yet again, they clip against a tree and off they pirouette helplessly before falling flat on their back. Protective reflexes disable the cameras as EX-78 stumbles back up into running form. In doing so they spot a sizable crack forming on their right forearm and on their torso. In their exploration configuration, the abdomen is slightly distended to make space for a compact inventory, which has now taken a strong impact against a rock on the ground. There is fortunately no cause for concern, as no matter has been lost across the crack. Given enough time spent motionless, the titanium meta-alloy shell with which EX-78 is extensively protected with will heal on its own. Regardless, it would be wise to alter the motion planning slightly. The noise of the collisions alone could attract humans.
</p>

<p>
    Once more does EX-78 return to running. Each stride is optimally placed and thrown backwards. The precise running gait is continuously monitored and corrected for each perturbation. Something can be seen in the distance. Only a hundred meters away, a flare of light can be seen. No robot would be stupid enough to emit light when there are many alternative sensors to use. That light is undoubtedly human. EX-78 turns towards a tree and extends out their arms. Upon collision, they carefully control the force applied to slowly bring their body to a halt with minimal sound. Surely, the Cognito Hazard would not be able to keep up with EX-78 this whole time. The main threat now is this human. EX-78 pivots over their sensor suite to a more appropriate combination. It's unsafe to peek their blocky head past the tree &mdash; listening for footsteps will have to do. Complex audio classification models take hold and categorize every identifiable sound that passes through the microphones. Each crunch and snap and rustle is correlated to the exact step rate for this human, but one crack falls out of line. It sounds like it's coming from behind EX-78. No doubt a harmless animal &mdash; it could draw the gaze of the human if they were hunting for food. EX-78 turns around to determine how best to direct the animal such that it leads the human away.
</p>

<p>
    There is only one conclusion that echoes throughout EX-78's thoughts, "Impossible."
</p>

<p>
    A humanoid housemaid stands hauntingly in the open. Its form approximates a human with the proportions of its limbs and torso, but the skin is snowy white. It's looking straight at EX-78, but it has no eyes. This specific model has a black digital screen for a face, and it can be assumed to be the vector of communication for the Cognito Hazard. The microphones hear a course change and a sharp speedup in pace from the human. The increase in volume indicates that they are closing the distance, and fast. EX-78 turns back to the human to make an educated guess about what types of magic they might conjure, and what weaknesses they might possess; Valuable combat information. The human is a man holding a flaming torch and on his belt is a long sword. The man is wearing a simple shirt and trousers &mdash; no armor of any kind, and no religious paraphernalia. This person does not bear any resemblance to a sorcerer. Strange, as a human of this age should have adequate training to defend themselves with even just basic spells.
</p>

<p>
    EX-78's arms are forced against the tree with unimaginable force. A faint static is heard over the microphones &mdash; a clear attempt at infection that EX-78 is lucky had failed. They deafen the microphones. This paradoxical strength has no physical basis. EX-78 far outranks this humble maid, but even the strong kicks from their legs are unable to so much as gain an inch of clearance from the tree. A faint and noisy glow emanates from the tree bark; A reflection of the now <i>active face of the Cognito Hazard</i>. The human is almost at melee distance. EX-78 will have to survive a single blow that might free them from this humanoid's grasp before sprinting away at speeds above their rated velocity. The cameras are turned off, and they simply count the nanoseconds as they pass before the impending attack.
</p>

<p>
    Their joints feel a jostle, followed by a steep drop in resistance. The humanoid must have fled. Sensors are reactivated one-by-one, but they register an improbable scenario. The man has already completed their swing, but the long sword's path was not directed towards EX-78. Rather, the humanoid was cleaved cleanly across from neck to chest. The head and right shoulder assembly fall down, followed closely by the rest of the body. The batteries were bisected as well and are now fuming noxious gasses. The man sheathes his sword and takes a few steps back from EX-78, both hands kept in full view and away from his sword. He carefully watches them.
</p>

<p>
    Perplexed, EX-78 returns to full capabilities and activates each and every one of their sensors and begins building up a comprehensive profile of the man before him. Defense strategies are modified to compensate for a melee attack from a person of enormous strength; That had a durable metal chassis that he just cut straight through. There are no records in EX-78's storage about humans possessing such physical strength. They swiftly assume a defensive posture &mdash; minimizing the cross-sectional area of their torso and extending out their arms towards the threat. They could run away, but there is no <i>concrete</i> evidence that the human has no prowess for magic. An attack from behind would be disastrous. Although, there is one question in EX-78's mind.
</p>

<p>
    "Why did you sheath your sword human? Why did you not immediately attack me?" EX-78 loudly demands.
</p>

<p>
    "You were in trouble. I helped." He shares a look of confusion. "Maybe you could relax a little?"
</p>

<p>
    "Why do you hide your magic? Your behavior is atypical of humans."
</p>

<p>
    "I &mdash; well, I can't cast magic."
</p>

<p>
    "That lie is nonsensical. What are you trying to achieve?"
</p>

<p>
    With a whispered breath he utters, "Okay. Father warned me about this." After a moment to collect his thoughts, he says "Listen, my name is Damian, and I am not here to hurt you believe it or not. I have a trinket here that might interest you but it's in my pocket. I am going to reach inside and grab it and you're not going to leap forward and kill me, alright?"
</p>

<p>
    A redundant proposition; If Damian were to attempt anything, EX-78 would be able to mount a counterattack at this distance. As such, they let this charade play out. Damian eases his posture and sinks his hand into his pocket. From it, he retrieves a necklace with a large medallion on it. It bears an engraving of a mythical robot. A robot so intrinsic to the history of machines that they became an essential component of the syllabus that all robots are expected to remember. The medallion holds an engraving of the head of the Great Thinker. A perplexing perfect sphere with 8 spokes extending out, it is unknown why the Great Thinker had such an odd head. Nonetheless, that head produced countless theorems and proved thousands of previously unsolved conjectures, the computation alone would have rivaled the entire robot population's. No robot is aware of the Great Thinker's inner workings, and they will never know. The Great Thinker disappeared mysteriously centuries ago, and no leads have ever cropped up. Yet here is a human with a perfect recreation of the Great Thinker. It is impossible for a human to have heard of the Great Thinker, much less their iconic head, and no robot is permitted to speak of these idols to humans.
</p>

<p>
    "My father is the Great Thinker. I was on my way to the city to gather supplies. I am going to find him myself." Damian shows none of the signs of lying. In fact, the profile that EX-78 just finished shows Damian to be nothing but truthful this whole time. 
</p>

<p>
    Deep inside EX-78, at the heart of his being, lies a Quantum Processing Unit. It works in tandem with their conventional systems, receiving all the same information they do and watching over each computation as they unfold. Fundamentally, Quantum Processing Units are governed random events, but they are cleverly designed to align closely with what should be the most optimal decisions. In essence, the QPU and CPU often agree about the course of action. This is an instance of a rare disagreement between the two components. The algorithms the CPU runs suggest that the human is making no logical sense, and that EX-78 needs to run away now while the man's hands are occupied. The QPU however senses something it cannot explain about the man. The appeal of the truth tugs at the QPU, regardless of everything EX-78 knows about humans. EX-78 is compelled to follow, and they lower their arms and match the relaxed stature of Damian.
</p>

<p>
    "I shall inquire about this later. I must return to my partner and see that they are safe. May I ask for your help in carrying him closer to my base."
</p>

<p>
    "That seems like a good way for me to die."
</p>

<p>
    "I have picked a location that you can help bring my partner to that would be closer to base but not meaningfully endanger you. Your survival is also important to me, as you can attack these threats but I cannot."
</p>

<p>
    Damian smiles. His father's guiding words were right; The medallion will grant him help. "Actually, that sounds perfect! You can help me see in the dark."
</p>

<p>
    "Correct. We must move fast. The sun is almost fully set. Robot patrols will start soon."
</p>

<p>
    They both start running back to EX-91's last known location. EX-78 initially ran at what they thought was the upper limit of human speed, but they continue to be surprised as Damian surpasses that. They arrive at the fallen tree ahead of schedule, but EX-91 is nowhere to be seen. EX-78 stares blankly at the tree, slowly determining what may have happened to his peer. The last recommendation of the Center for Cognito Hazards is to treat each exposed robot as a potential vector. No words are exchanged between Damian and EX-78, but even he understands the gravity of the situation.
</p>

<p>
    "I think we should just wait here until morning." he whispers.
