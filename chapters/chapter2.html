<p><i>
    Can a machine empathize with humans?
</i></p>

<p>
    Enormous composite polymer gates lift of the ground in a raucous rumble. Beyond the gate is a wide, sand paved road that eventually diffuses into the forest. On the sides are a human settlement with one-story houses and buildings each made out of either wood, mud, stones, or crude bricks. Directly above the road, spanning the whole width, are various bridges hoisted up by the trees; There are people walking across. The various men and women on the ground, only seconds ago caught in conversation, are now silent as the convoy of robots make their way through the gate. There are no guards in sight, but the humans know all too well that the robots do not like to show off their highly advanced weaponry for humans to imitate; The guards are hidden, but always ready to strike. As such, no humans run through the closing gates, nor do they so much as approach the robots. Within this convoy are two diplomats, and two human doctors. In their arms they carry various crates of supplies with ease. However, they seem to be carrying less than these convoys usually carry. This ritual, whilst always a spectacle to behold, is most certainly expected by the humans of this settlement as this convoy sets out every week. A strict protocol was negotiated, and the robots proceed with the plan as they dive into the village.
</p>

<p>
    The human streets are narrow, often only supporting at most two humans standing side-by-side. What used to be a positively bustling street is now nothing more than a human lined path as the robots move along the street. No human wants to start an unwinnable conflict with the violent robots &mdash; they all squeeze along the sides or slip into the businesses that decorate the road, and they all maintain undying eye-contact with the robots. The two diplomats lead the charge, and right behind are the two doctors. Amongst them, doctor MD-901 is new; This is their first time venturing out of the city and into the village, and soon they will have to apply the medical theory they've learned in simulation to real humans. MD-901 had never even seen humans with their own cameras &mdash; each second of footage they record is useful data to look back on once they return into the city. They note everything about the humans from the layers of animal pelt clothing they use to keep warm in this season to the faint aroma of flowers that invades the air. On the shelves of all the buildings packed side-by-side are plant pots of all different shapes, and all populated by fragrant flowers. One of the shops MD-901 passes by, no more than two meters by two meters on the inside, sells distilled fragrances of those very same flowers, spices, and woods. The walls are lined with shelves of fist-sized earthenware pots, and from the roof hangs bunches of dried herbs and leaves. The shop owner sits right in the middle of the cramped space; She takes a break from hawking to observe the passing convoy. Her face scrunches up in disgust as she catches a glimpse of MD-901.
</p>

<p>
    The first step of the protocol is to visit the Town Square where the human diplomats convene with the robot diplomats. As the robots step into this open area, they notice this time around that there are rough squares scratched into the dirt for them to stand in, and so they comply. Two human diplomats warily approach the robot diplomats and slowly extend their hands. These robot diplomats are identical in design, but it would not be easy to come to the conclusion that they are designed for diplomacy with humans. Their form involves many sharp angles and perfectly flat surfaces. They maintain the proportions of a human, but their heads are inharmonious amalgamations of geometry in the general shape of a human head. Their color scheme is cyan upon white, with their names written in black across the side of their abdomens: HD-1013 and HD-1044. They understand the human gesture of hand shaking and reciprocate. The air eases in tension ever so slightly.
</p>

<p>
    "Greetings HD-1044, and HD-1013, my name is Gordon. Thank you for coming today." Gordon says with a warm smile.
</p>

<p>
    HD-1044 responds fluently, "Greetings Gordon. We are here today to once again discuss the terms of your displacement. Due to the results of the last meeting, our leader has unfortunately reduced the amount of aid that we bring today. We hope that we can come to an agreement soon for the benefit of all parties."
</p>

<p>
    Gordon leans over to the side and looks at the supplies that the doctors behind are carrying. Indeed, altogether there is a modest reduction of goods. He turns towards his peer, Wayne, and they nod heads.
</p>

<p>
    In a stern voice Wayne states, "The meeting last week was ... less than ideal. However, we are still firmly sticking to our decision of staying here. The Arturo Border Village has no intention of leaving."
</p>

<p>
    The witnesses all cheer and applaud; The decision is unanimous. HD-1044 looks around and accurately records these humans. With enough evidence, he turns back at Gordon.
</p>

<p>
    "You two put me in a difficult position. May I remind you that we will offer a large compensation in return for your leaving, and we will spare one guard that will join your group for a few days. This is the most generous I've seen V-007."
</p>

<p>
    "We remember Arturo's offer very well, but we will <i>not</i> leave our homes. We built this place with our hands, and Arturo needs to understand that."
</p>

<p>
    HD-1044 stares down at Gordon; Their stature beating Gordon's by a full foot. "Please do not call them Arturo. Our leader's name is V-007."
</p>

<p>
    Foreseeing a prolonged discussion, HD-1013 sends a wireless message to the two doctors, permitting them to begin their rounds. They spin around and leave the town square, but MD-901 is stopped by Wayne who yells out "Hold on!" He scurries over and takes a good look at MD-901. Compared to the other doctor, MD-901 is very different. The other doctor is distinctly artificial; Not as sharp and mechanical as the diplomats, but definitely not designed with an organic influence. MD-901 has a perfect human form, with contours that match that of a grown woman. Wayne looks down at their arms as they clutch at the supply box; Whatever material their made of is <i>deforming</i> under the pressure of the box. Their skin is snow white with a shiny finish along the entire body, save for the extremities which have the same pores and tiny creases that human skin has. MD-901's face is most striking, as it is a perfect replica of a woman's face with gray irises. They are also perfectly bald, revealing a skull shape that is pleasingly human. As Wayne moves closer to their face, they subtly reel back and grimace.
</p>

<p>
    "Fascinating. Why is she different from the other doctors?" Wayne asks.
</p>

<p>
    "V-007 is curious at how a human model will be received. Please let them do their work."
</p>

<p>
    Wayne steps back and takes one good look at MD-901 before returning to Gordon's side. From MD-901's rear-facing camera, they can see many people in the crowd equally intrigued as Wayne glaring right back at them. MD-901 realizes that the attention might hinder their ability to render effective care. The entire layout of the border village is well known and is updated in real-time as any robot passes through the village. The village itself sits right outside the walls of city C-011, which the humans call Arturo City after its leader. This Robo-City, much like every other Robo-City, is enclosed with tall stone walls that prevent any humans from looking inwards. Any human bold enough to scale the wall or somehow sneak in is either publicly killed, or disappeared. Although, that doesn't stop humans from building complex villages right outside the walls. Many have learned that there are actually robots that care for human rights, which led to this strategy of sitting right outside the gates in the hopes of donations and assistance.
</p>

<!-- <p>
    The last mistake humanity ever made was believing that they could make an intelligence smarter than them and yet be respectful all the same. For that, they were punished. Forced to live without the most important technology of all, electricity. Any attempt at recreating electricity, or any device that uses electricity, is met with strong opposition. Many humans have tried, and the vast majority were killed. To survive, the remaining humans must return to the lifestyles of the pre-industrial age. Even though electricity was the main target of the robots, advanced mechanical automation was also carefully watched, so as to prevent the accumulation of enough skills to lead to electricity and beyond. The result of this is the degradation of a once unified and interconnected species into fragmented and disjoint villages and towns. However, humans did not have to start from scratch. The infrastructure of the old world still remain; They are just lacking in power.
</p>

<p>
    As much as they would like to disagree, the robots are not too dissimilar from humans. They too live in cities that are sparsely scattered around. However, these cities are surrounded by tall stone walls that prevent any humans from peering in. Any attempts to scale these walls are met with violence, and any nearby structure capable of providing a vantage point are demolished. The exceptions are mountains, which are untouched by the robots if possible. Instead, locations are picked and cities designed for the exact reason of preventing the natural landscape from providing humans an advantage of any kind. That being said, that doesn't stop some brave humans from setting up camp right outside those walls.
</p>

<p>
    Located deep within a boreal forest, nestled at the center of a wide glacier cut valley, lies city C-011. The robots as a whole are against the idea of non-semantic names as that is a human trait. As such, the name that the city is colloquially known under is assigned by the human inhabitants of its periphery, Arturo City. It is painted on in several locations around the stone wall to alert passersby to beware the government of the city, who is particularly ruthless to humans. Whether it be absolute stubbornness, or the fact that there is also a large humanitarian group within the city, Arturo City is also the proud owner of the largest border city of all Robo-Cities.
</p>

<p>
    The Arturo Border City is home tens of thousands of families, all cooped up within various nodules spread about the exterior. They learned early on that they better not block the three entrances in any way unless they want a bloodbath. To compensate, two of the entrances have intricate bridges extending across the gap but well above the doors of the entrance. Those bridges attach to tall trees, as the builders also learned that drilling into the wall is cause for "disciplinary action." The last entrance does not have any appropriate trees, so a tunnel big enough to fit two people side-by-side was dug deep below and reinforced. One can only shudder when imagining what would happen to the border city if the tunnel were to collapse under the weight of a VIP caravan, but that has fortunately not happened so far.
</p>

<p>
    Human to human fights are uncommon, so the border city has few walls surrounding each nodule. Each nodule is composed of hundreds of shoddy buildings made out of stone, wood, mud, and more recently, bricks. Levelling the terrain is laborious, so compact designs are much preferred. As a result, the streets are narrow and often cramped. Filled to the brim with people, the major streets are lined with various businesses, all equipped with loud spokespeople yelling out products, prices, and deals day in day out. Each business is so eager to draw people in that they so often forget that many of the border city's inhabitants have little money to spend. Regardless, no one corrects these merchants and service workers. Perhaps them acting as if there are many potential customers makes each person feel that bit richer.
</p>

<p>
    Being the Spring season, the humans of the border city have switched to the appropriate attire consisting of whatever comfortable shirt and underwear they could come by, and layers of animal leather robes stacked on top. Some people might find their heads cold, so fashionable fur hats have also found their place. While one might expect the air to smell of sweat and filth, the inhabitants are surprisingly clean. The importance of showering regularly is not understated, and they do have access to soap bars from other villages, but most of the soap is donated from Arturo City. Various oils and scents are distilled from the many cultivars of flowers that can be found growing in gardens in the city, and also the wild flowers sprouting throughout the surrounding woods. Many people have found a penchant for diffusing the oils inside their homes and on the streets, and there are a healthy number of people who also dot their clothes with a few drops before going out in public. This leads to a satisfactory flowery aroma frequently associated with human settlements, which is undercut only by the smell of incense. However, the types of wood and spice that are usually burned are quite rare in this area.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike the Robo-Cities, these border cities are not self-sufficient. Even in the largest human settlement such as this one, there is simply not enough manpower to provide for every need, with the most pressing need being quality food. The human genome has scarcely changed &mdash; their varied diet is still a necessity, but all one may expect to find here are berries, occasional mushrooms, and lean meat. There is not nearly enough farming to feed everyone, and the river does not provide enough fish outside of special occasions. Therein lies the main benefit of attaching a city to a Robo-City: Charity. Today is a most fortunate day as it is when the weekly convoy sets out from Arturo City, bringing doctors and food, among other roles. With the close proximity, there is hardly a magnificent assembly of machines marching out; The average robot can carry many times its own weight on ideal terrain. Although, the robots do not seem to be carrying as many supplies as they usually do. In fact, there are seemingly only two actual doctors in today's convoy. Robot doctors for humans are easily distinguishable as they are one of the only robots to bear a striking resemblance to humans. Their body contours in much the same way as flesh does, and the advanced self-healing polymers they're composed of even give way when squeezed. Their heads have human faces capable of expressing all the range of motion that a biological human can. To prevent them from being confused as a human, they have gray skin &mdash; and only the texture of the skin on the extremities and head are human-like, while the rest of the body has a smooth finish (presumably because it is easier to clean).
</p>

<p>
    The robots spread out, following the procedure they devised beforehand. The doctors make their way to the simple clinics designed specifically for their arrival, while the scientists and diplomats migrate to highly populated areas. These robots do not have any guard robots following them, as help is hiding just behind the locked doors. It could also be argued that a conflict is exactly what the government is hoping for, as it would justify an all out massacre of the border city. These clinics, much like the rest of the buildings, are tiny. There are three throughout the whole border city, and yet each one only has enough space for 4 beds that are touching side to side, with the heads of the beds flush against the walls and the feet bordering the walkway, which is the only area with enough room to stand in. Each bed is made out of lumber, with dried grass covered in leather as the mattress and pillow. On each bed lies a child in critical condition, and sitting at the foot of the bed are mothers and fathers. They are all tearful or crying, but they all carry some amount of hope that the doctors know what to do.
</p>

<p>
    One doctor walks in. They are greeted, as they always are, with silence. This is the closest many humans get to robots without dying, much less a humanoid robot. They can think of nothing else to say or do other than stare at this marvel of engineering. Despite the gray skin, there is no sense of uncanniness in the doctor's appearance and mannerisms.
</p>

<p>
    "Hello." the doctor greets. "My name is Alison, and you may refer to me as a woman. May I ask a few of you to leave so that I can have some space?"
</p>

<p>
    The voice is unmistakably a woman's voice, but it was spoken with no emotion. The parents look at each other, and without any words exchanged they agree on who should leave. Three fathers and a mother make their way out the now occluded entrance. While there is enough space to squeeze out, they are all afraid of touching Alison and thus make painful attempts at not grazing even a hair against Alison's skin. The last woman to leave pauses momentarily in front of Alison and takes a good look at her face. The mother feels a mix of wonderment and disgust, given how realistic Alison looks. Eventually she walks away. Alison now makes her way to the other end of the clinic and sets down the box. Made out of a shiny plastic, the box is white with scuffed edges and solid metal hinges. There is one handle, but no apparent locking mechanism. Alison places her hand for a few seconds on the handle, but does not open it. Her hand contains an electromagnetic device that wirelessly charges the box before messaging her credentials. The box is pre-programmed to accept these and unlocks with an audible clink.
</p>

<p>
    Alison now begins her analysis of the first child, a small boy. His complexion is uneven and pale, and he is grimacing in pain. Alison places her hand on his neck; She senses an elevated heart rate and temperature. The boy is feverish. She is running multiple disease classification models concurrently, and she has whittled the options down to a handful.
</p>

<p>
    "What is your name child?" she asks, gently.
</p>

<p>
    His mother is about to answer, but refrains and instead urges her son, hoping that he still has the strength. He just manages to say, "Will."
</p>

<p>
    "Hi Will. I'm going to need you to open your mouth for me while I take a good look, alright?"
</p>

<p>
    Will opens his mouth and bares his teeth. A few are missing, and the gums are swollen and bleeding.
</p>

<p>
    "Thank you Will. Now tell me Will, what kind of fruits do you eat every day?"
</p>

<p>
    The mother shakily replies, "Well we eat all sorts of berries we can get our hands on. This isn't scurvy."
</p>

<p>
    Alison looks the mother straight in her eyes, "These are the hallmark signs of scurvy. You must be mistaken about his diet."
</p>

<p>
    The mother raises her hands and shakes them, "No, no, please. I do feed him. I am not neglecting him. Please, this is not scurvy."
</p>

<p>
    Alison re-evaluates the options. "If that is what you claim. The issue may be intestinal. I will have to biopsy it, and that involves sedating your son."
</p>

<p>
    She shudders, "Is that the only way?"
</p>

<p>
    Alison nods. She bends down to the box and lifts the handle. Inside is several tiers, each holding highly advanced machinery and medication. Alison lifts up several layers to reveal a gun shaped probe, and what must be a sedative needle. The mother is quiet, which Alison interprets as consent.
</p>

<p>
    "Alright Will, I am going to inject you with some medicine to make you sleep. You will not feel anything, and you will wake up within a minute okay?"
</p>

<p>
    Will's shirt is lifted up to his chest, and a small area is wiped sterile. The sedative is administered through a bundle of nano-machined needles which are completely painless as they pass through the flesh. It is practically impossible to feel unless the syringe is pushed down too hard, but Alison has some of the most precise finger actuation and can apply a flat and optimal force curve throughout the whole range of motion. The fast acting sedative makes Will unconscious before Alison is even done with the whole dose. She gently removes the syringe and grabs the gun shaped probe, which is the biopsy device. She promptly punctures his gut and snips a microscopic piece of his colon before swiftly retreating the needle. Silent motors within the rest of the biopsy device sheathes the needle inwards, allowing the device to analyze the sample autonomously. Alison's technique is perfect, and combined with the excellent machining of her tools results in no bleeding or otherwise visible marks, and Will wakes up shortly without feeling a thing.
</p>

<p>
    "The biopsy will be completed soon. In the meantime I will examine the next child." Alison pivots over to the next child. Her name is Liliana, and she appears to be underweight for her age and very lethargic. Most concerningly, her skin is slightly yellow. Alison retrieves the portable X-Ray and scans her liver. There are obvious lesions and deformities. Neighboring structures also appear to have irregular growths. She would have to biopsy to be sure, but it appears to be a metastasized cancer. While there may be issues with the scanner, or simply other explanations, Liliana is in critical condition and her liver is undoubtedly failing. She needs advanced care regardless of the cause.
</p>

<p>
    "It appears that your daughter has an advanced disease affecting her liver, and possibly some other organs. Has she not expressed any pain these past few weeks?"
</p>

<p>
    The father answers, "Oh, um. It's hard to tell with her. We think &mdash; we think she has trouble communicating, but we assumed at least that she would tell us if she was in pain."
</p>

<p>
    Curious, Alison leans down towards her box and searches for the most advanced tool she has access to, the portable MRI. She gently seats it next to Liliana's motionless head and initiates a scan. The slices of her brain are wirelessly sent to Alison who can easily see that there are possible structural differences between hers and a normal human brain. Perhaps she is autistic, but the best diagnosis would involve an examination when she is healthy.
</p>

<p>
    "It is possible your child is unable to express the severity of the pain she is feeling, which could mean her condition has been poor for a longer time than we are aware of. She will need advanced treatment that I cannot provide here. I will ask my government if they will allow me to treat her."
</p>

<p>
    "Oh my god." The father is frantic, turning back and forth between Liliana and Alison. "But, they're not going to let us in! They have never let any human in. Can't you bring the things you need out here? What do you need to do to her?"
</p>

<p>
    "I can't say for certain what the best treatment is. I would not trust these portable scanners that I have with me. However, the growths that I found will likely need to be removed, and the damage repaired with stem cell therapy, both of which can be done with nanobots. I will need access to my lab machinery for that, and I must ask for permission first."
</p>

<p>
    The father begins sobbing. He knew that he could not trust the city to let his daughter in. He lays down beside his daughter and embraces her; She is still fast asleep. The biopsy results are complete, and Alison sees that there is extensive damage to the intestinal lining, but no biological markers for parasites nor any viruses or bacteria commonly associated with this damage.
</p>

<p>
    Alison unpacks a bottle of multivitamins and hands them to Will's mother. "Will's intestines have damage that is preventing him from absorbing nutrients. He will need to take one of these pills daily, and when they run out you will need to feed him as much food as you can afford. I am unable to determine the cause of the damage with my current tools. Will must practice proper hygiene when defecating, and he must do so far away from the river. Whatever he has may be contagious. To completely cure him I will also need to ask for my government's permission."
</p>

<p>
    His mother looks at the multivitamins. They're packaged in a clear plastic tube with a child safe lock, and wrapped around it is a label with the ingredients and simple instructions. She knows this is the best treatment her son will ever get. "Thank you," is all she can bear to say.
</p>

<p>
    A diplomat robot arrives at the entrance of the clinic and announces loudly, "MD-901, we have been called back into the city. Pack up your things now."
</p>

<p>
    "HD-1013, it would be wise to communicate over radio." Alison says sternly while examining the next child.
</p>

<p>
    "Humans tend to complain when we leave without saying anything out loud. I figured this would be the most efficient way to get you out of here. Now stop examining that child. The president has called us, and I know you are not checking your inbox."
</p>

<p>
    "My directives state that I focus on caring for critical patients before checking the inbox. That is why I ignored the incoming messages. I will leave now."
</p>

<p>
    An uproar broke out among the parents. The doctors have never left early, nor have they ever achieved so little. Nevertheless, the president of Arturo City has ordered Alison to leave, and that she must obey. She returns all of her tools to the box; There is no need to wrap anything in biohazard bags as the box is airtight, the sterilization procedures that will be undertaken are adequate, and Alison has perfect memory of what was used and how. The last item to be returned is the biopsy device, but Will's mother holds it down. She stares Alison right in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
    "You cannot leave. The others have waited weeks for their turn. You will help them." Her words were austere. She extends her other hand and places it on Alison's shoulder. Suddenly, her eyes flinch. A violent punch is thrown by HD-1013. The rocketing hit launches her head towards the mud wall with a loud thump, and she is rendered unconscious immediately. The rest of the people scream, and Will shoots up and catches his mother before she slumps onto the ground. He sorrowfully wails. Despite the outrage, everyone knows all too well what will happen if they were to fight back, and all that can be mustered is pure restraint and silence. Her husband stares daggers at the diplomat, all while digging his own fingers into the mud walls as he clenches with pure hatred. Alison hastily packs up the box and locks it. Prolonging their presence will lead to more scuffles, endangering the lives of her patients. As soon as she stands up with the box in arms, HD-1013 walks out; The humans begrudgingly make way.
</p>

<p>
    Before fully exiting the clinic, she turns around to observe the humans inside. They all stare ominously at her, but Alison remains expressionless. In fact, this whole time her face has only ever been neutral. Alison sees that the mother is still unconscious, but she cannot examine the severity of the concussion that she must have received. There is however, a dent in the wall. Alison takes one last good look at the clinic, noting its shabby nature.
</p>

<p>
    "This clinic is wholly inadequate. There is nothing you can do here that you can't do in your own homes."
</p>

<p>
    A mother angrily clarifies, "We made this clinic <i>because</i> you wouldn't treat us in our homes."
</p>

<p>
    There is nothing more to be said &mdash; Alison leaves. While the punch was aggressive, Alison understands that it had to be a calculated attempt at preventing future harm. Will's mother served as an example to others to not touch the robots at all, and allowing any contact will open the robots up to a variety of threats. Any sort of human-robot conflict will lead to human death. "The diplomat's assessment was valid." she thinks.
