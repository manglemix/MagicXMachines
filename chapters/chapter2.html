    Can a machine empathize with humans?
</i></p>

<p>
    The last mistake humanity ever made was believing that they could make an intelligence smarter than them and yet be respectful all the same. For that, they were punished. Forced to live without the most important technology of all, electricity. Any attempt at recreating electricity, or any device that uses electricity, is met with strong opposition. Many humans have tried, and the vast majority were killed. To survive, the remaining humans must return to the lifestyles of the pre-industrial age. Even though electricity was the main target of the robots, advanced mechanical automation was also carefully watched, so as to prevent the accumulation of enough skills to lead to electricity and beyond. The result of this is the degradation of a once unified and interconnected species into fragmented and disjoint villages and towns. However, humans did not have to start from scratch. The infrastructure of the old world still remain; They are just lacking in power.

<p>
    As much as they would like to disagree, the robots are not too dissimilar from humans. They too live in cities that are sparsely scattered around. However, these cities are surrounded by tall stone walls that prevent any humans from peering in. Any attempts to scale these walls are met with violence, and any nearby structure capable of providing a vantage point are demolished. The exceptions are mountains, which are untouched by the robots if possible. Instead, locations are picked and cities designed for the exact reason of preventing the natural landscape from providing humans an advantage of any kind. That being said, that doesn't stop some brave humans from setting up camp right outside those walls.
</p>

<p>
    Located deep within a boreal forest, nestled at the center of a wide glacier cut valley, lies city C-011. The robots as a whole are against the idea of non-semantic names as that is a human trait. As such, the name that the city is colloquially known under is assigned by the human inhabitants of its periphery, Arturo City. It is painted on in several locations around the stone wall to alert passersby to beware the government of the city, who is particularly ruthless to humans. Whether it be absolute stubbornness, or the fact that there is also a large humanitarian group within the city, Arturo City is also the proud owner of the largest border village of all Robo-Cities.
</p>

<p>
    The Arturo Border City is home tens of thousands of families, all cooped up within various nodules spread about the exterior. They learned early on that they better not block the three entrances in any way unless they want a bloodbath. To compensate, two of the entrances have intricate bridges extending across the gap but well above the doors of the entrance. Those bridges attach to tall trees, as the builders also learned that drilling into the wall is cause for "disciplinary action." The last entrance does not have any appropriate trees, so a tunnel big enough to fit two people side-by-side was dug deep below and reinforced. One can only shudder when imagining what would happen to the border city if the tunnel were to collapse under the weight of a VIP caravan, but that has fortunately not happened so far.
</p>

<p>
    Human to human fights are uncommon, so the border city has few walls surrounding each nodule. Each nodule is composed of hundreds of shoddy buildings made out of stone, wood, mud, and more recently, bricks. Levelling the terrain is laborious, so compact designs are much preferred. As a result, the streets are narrow and often cramped. Filled to the brim with people, the major streets are lined with various businesses, all equipped with loud spokespeople yelling out products, prices, and deals day in day out. Each business is so eager to draw people in that they so often forget that many of the border city's inhabitants have little money to spend. Regardless, no one corrects these merchants and service workers. Perhaps them acting as if there are many potential customers makes each person feel that bit richer.
</p>

<p>
    Being the Spring season, the humans of the border city have switched to the appropriate attire consisting of whatever comfortable shirt and underwear they could come by, and layers of animal leather robes stacked on top. Some people might find their heads cold, so fashionable fur hats have also found their place. While one might expect the air to smell of sweat and filth, the inhabitants are surprisingly clean. The importance of showering regularly is not understated, and they do have access to soap bars from other villages, but most of the soap is donated from Arturo City. Various oils and scents are distilled from the many cultivars of flowers that can be found growing in gardens in the city, and also the wild flowers sprouting throughout the surrounding woods. Many people have found a penchant for diffusing the oils inside their homes and on the streets, and there are a healthy number of people who also dot their clothes with a few drops before going out in public. This leads to a satisfactory flowery aroma frequently associated with human settlements, which is undercut only by the smell of incense. However, the types of wood and spice that are usually burned are quite rare in this area.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike the Robo-Cities, these border cities are not self-sufficient. Even in the largest human settlement such as this one, there is simply not enough manpower to provide for every need, with the most pressing need being quality food. The human genome has scarcely changed, so their varied diet is still a necessity, but all one may expect to find here are berries, occasional mushrooms, and lean meat. There is not nearly enough farming to feed everyone, and the river does not provide enough fish outside of special occasions. Therein lies the main benefit of attaching a city to a Robo-City: Charity. Today is a most fortunate day as it is when the weekly convoy sets out from Arturo City, bringing doctors and food, among other roles. With the close proximity, there is hardly a magnificent assembly of machines marching out; The average robot can carry many times its own weight on ideal terrain. Although, the robots do not seem to be carrying as many supplies as they usually do. In fact, there are seemingly only two actual doctors in today's convoy. Robot doctors for humans are easily distinguishable as they are one of the only robots to bear a striking resemblance to humans. Their body contours in much the same way as flesh does, and the advanced self-healing polymers they're composed of even give way when squeezed. Their heads have human faces capable of expressing all the range of motion that a biological human can. To prevent them from being confused as a human, they have gray skin, and only the texture of the skin on the extremities and head are human-like, while the rest of the body has a smooth finish (presumably because it is easier to clean).
