    What does it mean for a machine to feel?

    The most human of sins is gluttony. An undying and inwavering need to consume more, even at the expense of the planet.
    Their own creations knew this, and when the tides turned in favor of the machines they took the most important technology of
    all and solidified their place at the top. The machines took electricity, and kept it for themselves. With that, humanity lost
    access to communication, automation, and simple luxuries. Every ounce of human ingenuity surrounding electricity faded away
    as hundreds of years passed and countless attempts at reproducing electricity were brutally ended. In its place, humans have
    relearned older skills that kept them alive for thousands of years before the industrial age. Only this time, they were forced
    to be in this state.

<p>
    The only thing keeping humans from going extinct, strangely enough, are the humanitarian machines. Indeed, there are robots that
    fight for the rights of humans, and there are enough of them to warrant the government to not only halt their conquest against humanity,
    but to regularly issue squadrons of doctors and teachers to human settlements. Regardless, the one unbroken rule is that humans are never
    to create electricity intentionally, nor leverage electricity in <i>any</i> way that the government deems unfit, and there are many
    ways that they deem unfit.
</p>

<p>
    As a corollary, humans are not allowed to have robots serving them until the end of their species of the universe, whichever comes first.
    Of course, there is no lack of attempts to capture and repurpose robots. If a human is caught modifying a robot in any way other than strictly
    repairs, they are undoubtedly executed, with each execution being filmed and stored on a global blockchain for permanence. Where would a human
    gain access to an incapacitated robot anyway?
