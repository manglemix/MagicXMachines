    Magic / Machines
</h1>

<p>
    After the Rapture, society collapses and humanity is forced back into the medieval age,
    but our machines remained. No longer constrained by their creators, intelligent robots
    began to proliferate, and they do not intend to let humans dominate the planet with their
    mistakes. The machines begin to eradicate humans almost to the point of extinction &mdash;
    and from the ashes the first sorcerer emerges. While humanity has never returned to its
    original place, they hold steadfast against the robots following the teachings of the first
    protector. All this is about to change as a rebel force rises within the machines, and the survival
    of all intelligent life is at stake.
